<p>Flow is an installation that uses your voice to generate random patterns of sound. As you make noise of any kind you interact with a constant stream of background music, pushing it in different directions. Flow comes with reverb controls (Q,W), chorus controls (E,R), volume controlers (O,P), and a comb filter effect (Up, Down) with different chords (1,2,3,4). When listening, imagine using it in a relaxation center such as Windhover, where instead of a background trickle of water, you have a background Flow that you are able to interact with as you move around. </p>
